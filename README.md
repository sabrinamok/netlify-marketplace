<summary><b>Routing</b></summary>
<p>
  This project uses <a target="_blank" href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start">React Router</a> and includes a convenient <code>useRouter</code> hook (located in <code><a href="src/util/router.js">src/util/router.js</a></code>) that wraps React Router and gives all the route methods and data you need.

```js
import { Link, useRouter } from "./../util/router.js";

function MyComponent() {
  // Get the router object
  const router = useRouter();

  // Get value from query string (?postId=123) or route param (/:postId)
  console.log(router.query.postId);

  // Get current pathname
  console.log(router.pathname);

  // Navigate with the <Link> component or with router.push()
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      <button onClick={(e) => router.push("/about")}>About</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<summary><b>Deployment</b></summary>
<p>
Install the Netlify CLI

```
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

Link codebase to a Netlify project (choose the "create and deploy manually" option)

```
netlify init
```

Add each variable from your `.env` file to your Netlify project, including ones prefixed with "REACT_APP\_". You can also use the Netlify UI for this by going to your Site settings â†’ Build & Deploy â†’ Environment.

```
netlify env:set VARIABLE_NAME value
```

Build for production

```
npm run build
```

Then run this command to deploy to Netlify
```
netlify deploy
```
